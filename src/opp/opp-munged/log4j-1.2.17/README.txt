README - Janklab-Munged Apache Log4j 1.2.15
===========================================

## UNOFFICIAL RELEASE

THIS PACKAGE IS NOT AN OFFICIAL OR REGULAR RELEASE OF LOG4J. IT IS A SPECIAL "MUNGED" VERSION FOR USE WITH JANKLAB SLF4M.

THIS LIBRARY WILL NOT WORK AS A DROP-IN REPLACEMENT FOR LOG4J. ITS PACKAGE NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED, AND THERE MAY BE OTHER CODE OR BEHAVIOR CHANGES.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE APACHE LOG4J PROJECT FOR SUPPORT WITH THIS PACKAGE. THEY WERE NOT INVOLVED IN ITS CREATION, ASIDE FROM BEING THE ORIGINAL CREATORS OF THE UPSTREAM CODE. (Thank you, Apache!)

For more info, see: <https://github.com/janklab/SLF4M/issues/14>

## Work in progress

This code is still a work in progress. In particular, not all of the references to the main Apache Log4j project and its resources have been modified to reflect that this is a special Janklab release. Regardless of what you read in the code, this is *not* the official Log4j library, and is not supported by Apache.
