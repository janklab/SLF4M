# README - mine - shmorg.SLF4J

(By Andrew Janke; that's "me".)

This is my first attempt at making a separate cloned SLF4J 1.5.8 library to use in Matlab R2020a+ to work around the log4j 2.x upgrade shizz.

The stuff in here is just a copy of the SLF4J 1.5.8 source, with my trying to change "org.slf4j" to "shmorg.slf4j" globally, and that's it.

I maybe want to publish this canonically so I can share artifacts between my hobby SLF4M project and my work stuff.
